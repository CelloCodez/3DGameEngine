Ideas/Notes:

Game engine!

Things to do:

Physics
Sound
Events (like OnTouch then play a sound, OnTouch then open a door, etc. to make simple games)
Prefabs (Planes, Cubes, Spheres)
3D Picking (within the physics engine; can  be used in level editor for object selection and movement with mouse)
Level Editor
Developer-Optional Active Objective System (if wanted in editor, then a game can have objectives like "Get to the Exit" that scripts can activate and modify)
(Minimal) Scripting
--> From Scripting: A Library of Scripts (Player/First Person Camera, Time of day script for Direction Lights, etc.)
